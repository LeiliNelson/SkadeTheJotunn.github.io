    <h2>About Norse Mythology</h2>
    <p>Norse Mythology is the ancient religion of the Vikings who came from the land of Scandinavia. Norse Mythology was originally the Norse's way of understanding the world around them, and slowly it evolved into tales of cunning and magic. Our greatest source for Norse Mythology are Snorri Sturlson's <em>The Eddas</em>. <br><br> Norse Mythology is used in many present day things. The days of the week deprive their names from Norse gods and goddesses and movies have been made using Norse Mythology, along with many books crafting NOrse Mythology into modern-day world.</p>

    <h4>Aesir Gods and Goddesses</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Odin or Woden:</strong> The ruler/leader of the Aesir. He is very cunning and has made many sacrifices to gain knowledge. He once hung himself from a tree for nine days to learn how to read the runes (words that can cast spells). He gives his name to Wednesday, or Woden's Day.</li>
      <li><strong>Thor or Porr:</strong> The god of thunder and the son of Odin. He has a hammer, Mjolnir, in which he uses to kill frost giants. His name is the origin of Thursday.</li>
      <li><strong>Loki:</strong> The adopted brother of Odin who is half frost giant. He causes much trouble for the Aesir and has to help them out of trouble, both of his making and of theirs.</li>
      <li><strong>Heimdall:</strong> He is the gatekeeper of the gods. He guards the entrance to Asgard and the rainbow bridge that connects Midgard and Asgard (see <em>The Nine Realms</em>). When Ragnarok comes, he will blow his horn to signal that it has started.</li>
      <li><strong>Frigg or Frigga:</strong> She is the queen of the Aesir and Odin's favorite wife. She knows much of the future but doesn't tell anyone what she knows. She is associated with love and marriage and gives her name to Friday.</li>
      <li><strong>Tyr:</strong> He is the bravest of the gods. He once placed his hand in the mouth of Fenrir (or Fenris) so that Fenrir could be bound. Fenrir then bit Tyr's hand off. His mother is a goddess and married to a frost giant. His name is associtaed with Tuesday. </li>
      <li><strong>Balder or Baldur:</strong> He is the shining god and he is loved by all, supposedly. When Frigg heard that he would be killed, she asked everything to not hurt him, except for Mistletoe. Loki heard of this and made a mistletoe dart and tricked Hod (Balder's blind brother) into throwing it at Balder, killing him.</li>
      <li><strong>Sif:</strong> She is the wife of Thor and is best known for having the most beautiful golden hair. It was cut off by Loki and replaced with a dwarven made wig of real, golden (and I mean <em>gold</em>) hair. She is also said to be the Aesir goddess of grain.</li>
      <li><strong>Idunn:</strong> She is the goddess of youth and guards the golden apples that the Aesir eat to remain youthful. Once, Loki was used by a giant to trick Idunn into being taken by a frost giant. While she was gone, the Aesir grew old, and so, Loki had to once again, get them out of trouble and bring back Idunn and her golden apples.</li>
      <li><strong>Bragi:</strong> He is the god of poetry. It is possible that Bragi may have been an actual man because some of the oldest Norse poets we know of was named "Bragi the Old." Bragi is married to Idunn because Odin thought that the poet should have the goddess of youth, saying it was only fitting.</li>
