    <h2>Aesir</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Odin or Woden:</strong> The ruler/leader of the Aesir. He is very cunning and has made many sacrifices to gain knowledge. He once hung himself from a tree for nine days to learn how to read the runes (words that can cast spells). He gives his name to Wednesday, or Woden's Day.</li>
      <li><strong>Thor or Porr:</strong> The god of thunder and the son of Odin. He has a hammer, Mjolnir, in which he uses to kill frost giants. His name is the origin of Thursday.</li>
      <li><strong>Loki:</strong> The adopted brother of Odin who is half frost giant. He causes much trouble for the Aesir and has to help them out of trouble, both of his making and of theirs.</li>
      <li><strong>Heimdall:</strong> He is the gatekeeper of the gods. He guards the entrance to Asgard and the rainbow bridge that connects Midgard and Asgard (see <a href="./ninerealms.html">The Nine Realms</a>). When Ragnarok comes, he will blow his horn to signal that it has started.</li>
      <li><strong>Frigg or Frigga:</strong> She is the queen of the Aesir and Odin's favorite wife. She knows much of the future but doesn't tell anyone what she knows. She is associated with love and marriage and gives her name to Friday.</li>
      <li><strong>Tyr:</strong> He is the bravest of the gods. He once placed his hand in the mouth of Fenrir (or Fenris) so that Fenrir could be bound. Fenrir then bit Tyr's hand off. His mother is a goddess and married to a frost giant. His name is associtaed with Tuesday. </li>
      <li><strong>Balder or Baldur:</strong> He is the shining god and he is loved by all, supposedly. When Frigg heard that he would be killed, she asked everything to not hurt him, except for Mistletoe. Loki heard of this and made a mistletoe dart and tricked Hod (Balder's blind brother) into throwing it at Balder, killing him.</li>
      <li><strong>Sif:</strong> She is the wife of Thor and is best known for having the most beautiful golden hair. It was cut off by Loki and replaced with a dwarven-made wig of real, golden (and I mean <em>gold</em>) hair. She is also said to be the Aesir goddess of grain.</li>
      <li><strong>Idunn:</strong> She is the goddess of youth and guards the golden apples that the Aesir eat to remain youthful. Once, Loki was used by a giant to trick Idunn into being taken by a frost giant. While she was gone, the Aesir grew old, and so, Loki had to once again, get them out of trouble and bring back Idunn and her golden apples. I have seen her depcited as a Vanir goddess, but it is very rare.</li>
      <li><strong>Bragi:</strong> He is the god of poetry. It is possible that Bragi may have been an actual man because some of the oldest Norse poets we know of was named "Bragi the Old." Bragi is married to Idunn because Odin thought that the poet should have the goddess of youth, saying it was only fitting.</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Vanir</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Frey or Freyr:</strong> As the twin brother of Freya (or Freyja), he is the god of fertility, sun, and rain. He is sometimes protrayed as a ruthless war-lord, while other times he is associated with peace. He is the son of Njord. He is sometimes invited to join the council of the Aesir and that is how he got is golden-bristled boar. One tale about hime involves that giantess Gerd. He sat upon Odin's throne that could see everything, looking for his sister, but instead he saw the most beautiful giantess maiden and he instantly fell in love. He sent his servant to fetch her, but he had to give up his sword. Without his sword, it meant his ultimate demise at Ragnarok. He gave it up, and after waiting 9 long days, he met with the giantess and he melted her icey heart and they were married. </li>
    <li><strong>Freya or Freyja:</strong> She is the twin sister of Frey and is also the goddess of fertility. She is also often considered the goddess of love. She is known for having a chariot that is pulled by cats and having an undying desire for gold. </li>
    <li><strong>Njord:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Ullr:</strong></li> 
    <li><strong>Kvasir</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Od or Odr:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Hnoss and Gersemi:</strong></li>
